# todo:

- [x] eslint, portsoc eslint config
- [x] readme detailed description
- [x] remove the button from Untracked changes
- [x] svg after gitlens; light and dark
- [x] change git.ts into something like module
- [x] why does diff viewer not remember viewed state?
- [x] fire file events every time I press the button
- [x] add commands for staged and working tree diffs
- [x] figure out how to make reload with open diffs work
- [x] read and follow ux guidelines
- [x] change icon to codicon book?
- [x] publish!
- [x] change waiting for git from endless loop to loop that finishes, move that
      to a function
- [x] fix to work reliably with non-git files open
- [x] add the button to stashes, too
- [x] fix diff viewer's line clicking
- [x] ignore whitespace with diffEditor.ignoreTrimWhitespace setting
- [ ] refactor so the code is nice
- [ ] maybe add tests?
- [ ] try adding the button to mhutchie's Git Graph extension
- [x] try adding the button to GitLens commit compare
- [x] try adding the button to GitLens branches
- [x] try adding the button to GitLens file history
- [ ] try adding the button on Paused at commit... in gitlens commits when
      rebasing
- [ ] add refresh button, inline/side-by-side toggle, ignore whitespace toggle?
- [ ] make diffviewer preserve scroll position on refresh?
- [ ] refresh on setting change?
- [ ] any github issues
- [ ] make diffviewer honour the default diff inline/side-by-side toggle?
- [ ] make diffviewer honour the normal setting to ignore whitespace; can it
      adopt the same ignore-whitespace button as normal diffs have?
- [ ] make diffviewer honour both zoom settings I use? (vscode doesn't make that
      easy)
- [ ] shorten (or make configurable somehow) diffviewer loading delay
- [ ] make diffviewer have a reset button for the files viewed line, or view all
      button that views/unviews all
- [x] show untracked files in stash diffs
- [ ] can whole diff have some kind of "show commit information" bit? diff
      viewer may not be able to show any kind of comments, maybe it could add
      that; or there could be a button to go use git lens or something to say
      something about the commit...
